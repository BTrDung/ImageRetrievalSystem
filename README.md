## Multiple techniques to enhance performance in CNN-based Image Retrieval systems
  
</div>

### Abstract 
Activations on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) served as image descriptors have reached its peak in the field of image retrieval due to their outstanding efficiency and compactness of representation. However, there is a massive need of annotated data and high quality annotation is a significance to achieve reasonable results. Throughout this work, we do fine-tune CNNs for image retrieval system on a collection of unordered images automatically. The selection of the train data could be guided using state-of-the-art retrieval and Structure-from-Motion methods to reconstruct 3D models. We additionally apply a novel trainable Generalized-Mean pooling layer generalizing max and average pooling for a boosting in retrieval performance. And we would conduct our experiments with VGG and ResNet architectures on Oxford5k, Paris6k, ROxford5k and RParis6k benchmarks.

### 1. Introduction
Throughout this work, we choose the approach as the unsupervised CNNs fine-tuning for image retrieval. Firstly, we harness SfM information and enforce for both hard unmatched and matched examples for CNNs training. Secondly, we let our architectures learn the whitening through the same training data to avoid the short representations that are the limitations from traditional whitening performance. We choose to use a trainable pooling layer which generalizes existing popular pooling schemes for CNNs and thus both enhances the performance and preserving the same descriptor dimensionality as well, lastly.

### 4. Experimental configuration
We used pre-trained ResNet101-GeM and VGG16-GeM to perform the fine-tuning. We conduct our experiments using NVIDIA @ RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB RAM with 11th Gen IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-11700K @ 3.60GHzÃ—16 CPU and PyTorch framework.

### 5. Results
#### Reproduce our final results
```bash
cd src/public/script/cnnimageretrieval-pytorch 

python3 -m cirtorch.examples.test \
